# Skills

Deep, single-topic capabilities. Load the relevant skill into your agent's context for
focused, expert implementation guidance. Each file follows the same structure: **Overview ·
Use Cases · Best Practices · Anti-Patterns · Checklist · Code Examples · Common Interview
Questions · AI Implementation Notes**.

**Platform layout.** Skills are split by platform inside each topic — `<topic>/ios/`,
`<topic>/android/`, `<topic>/flutter/`, … — and each file declares `platform:` in its
front-matter. Load only the platform you're working on. Each entry below is tagged with its
platform; iOS is the most complete set, and Flutter ships a foundation pack. Porting a skill? Add
it in the sibling platform folder and cross-link its counterpart (see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#repository-layout-platforms)). Flutter package choices are
centralized in [`standards/flutter_standards.md`](../standards/flutter_standards.md#package-baseline).
